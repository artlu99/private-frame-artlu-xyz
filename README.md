# REPO

This is a vanilla Next14 App Router + React18 app serving a simple Frog.fm frame, ready to deploy to Vercel in a handful of clicks.

The UX works fine for me, and data is stored in Vercel's experimental `Edge Config Store`, which is so low-impact that it might as well be free forever. If you need more scale, portability, or ease of use, consider:

- another of Vercel's (more powerful) data stores
- SQLite on Turso
- Redis on Upstash
- Mongo/Postgres at different hosting services that compete for developer value

The repo also specifies a development Neynar API key. Replace this with your own key before deploying to `PROD`. The Neynar docs are very clear about how to do this.

## Development

```
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

Head to <http://localhost:3000/api>

## Deploy to Vercal

Update `app/constants.ts` with your own title and Github URL.

Commit to Github, create a new project in Vercel and link it to the repo, click and deploy.

After first  deployment, you must connect a Vercel `Edge Config Store` database to this project and re-deploy. Easiest way is via the Dashboard, and it can also be done via the CLI.

Sample format:

```code
